# AD_modifiedDecisionTree_reanalysis
Workflow for AD brain data reanalysis using DirectMS1+Modified Decision Tree described in the manuscript: A modified decision tree improves generalization across multiple brains proteomic data sets for Alzheimerâ€™s disease


To further show how to apply the proposed methodology for other studies, we repeated our methodology for recently published Montaser et al. work on mouse model of retinal degeneration (10.1016/j.mcpro.2024.100855) which combines data from multiple mouse cohorts, mouse models, laboratories, mass spectrometers and data acquisition types. This example re-analysis is provided in the folder "mouse_study", although limited to demonstrating the bulk results without extensive follow-up details.
